# HTML Debug

Generally when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:

- **Syntax errors**: These are spelling or punctuation errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown above. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error messages mean.
- **Logic errors**: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that the program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

HTML itself doesn't suffer from syntax errors because browsers parse it permissively, meaning that the page still displays even if there are syntax errors.

HTML is parsed permissively because when the web was first created, it was decided that allowing people to get their content published was more important than making sure the syntax was absolutely correct.
